# RIT-PHYS222-Electronic-Measurements

This repository includes the lab guides developed for PHYS 222 Electronic Measurements at Rochester Institute of Technology that were used in Spring 2021 and Spring 2022.

## Audience: 
PHYS 222 is a required laboratory course for physics majors at RIT, typically taken in the Spring of 2nd year. The course is typically taken after PHYS 225, Introduction to Computational Physics. 

## History
Labs 1-8 and the lecture activities about MOSFET transistors and Digital circuits are adapted from RIT electronics lab guides that were in use in 2020 and prior. Labs 9 and 10, where students build and test an optical pulse sensor, was based on an [Instructables Simple DIY Pulse Sensor](https://www.instructables.com/Simple-DIY-Pulse-Sensor/) project. Labs 9 and 10 were developed and tested in collaboration with Jim Tillapaugh, who was a lab technician in the School of Physics and Astronomy in 2021. 

## Unique features

* The course was designed to work during the COVID pandemic. Each student received a kit of parts, which included a digital multimeter and the [ADALM2000](https://www.analog.com/en/design-center/evaluation-hardware-and-software/evaluation-boards-kits/adalm2000.html) USB oscilloscope, waveform generator, and DC power supply. The kit also included all the necessary discrete components, jumper wires, and a breadboard. 
* The lab guides are provided as Jupyter notebooks. Jupyter notebooks allow students to include theoretical calculations, executable Python code for data analysis, text description, schematics, and photos of circuits in their document. The ability to freely blend modeling, data anlaysis and descriptions is a major benefit. 
* The lab guides are provided through a JupyterHub server where students download their own copy of the lab guide and submit it. The cells have addition metadata for the [nbgrader package](https://nbgrader.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).  Nbgrader streamlines the distribution, submission, collection, and grading of Jupyter notebooks, and it is very efficient on a JupyterHub server.  
    * You can learn more about configuring a JupyterHub server though a [wiki tutorial and videos](https://wiki.rit.edu/display/JupyterForTeaching/JupyterHub+Tutorial).
